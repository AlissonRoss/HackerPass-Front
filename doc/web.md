## Keys

**Definitions**

`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`

Some secret Flask key. It can be anything, and is usually random.

`HP_KEYS`

An array of 64-bit HackerPass unit keys. These should be the same as in each unit's `/src/ino/HackerPass/config.h`. These should be sufficiently unpredictable to protect against bruteforce attacks. Knowing an HP key may authorize an attacker to make unauthorized requests.ยน

## Footnotes

1. Security is not a primary consideration of HackerPass 1.0 as 1.0 is merely a proof-of-concept. However, it will become more important for 2.0.
