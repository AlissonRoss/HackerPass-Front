# Documentation: web

**web** contains all the web application API, databases, and front-end for the HackerPass system.

## Keys

Related file(s): [`keys.py`](https://github.com/shawnduong/HackerPass/blob/main/src/web/keys.py)

**Definitions**

`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`

Some secret Flask key. It can be anything, and is usually random.

`HP_KEYS`

An array of 64-bit HackerPass unit keys. These should be the same as in each unit's `/src/ino/HackerPass/config.h`. These should be sufficiently unpredictable to protect against bruteforce attacks. Knowing an HP key may authorize an attacker to make unauthorized requests.ยน

## Database

Related file(s): [`models.py`](https://github.com/shawnduong/HackerPass/blob/main/src/web/models.py) (generates: `database.sqlite`)

## HP API

Related file(s): [`api.py`](https://github.com/shawnduong/HackerPass/blob/main/src/web/api.py)

HackerPass (HP) API calls are enacted by HackerPass units. HackerPass units must specify their `HP_KEY` as the `key` request argument (`?key=<HP_KEY>`) in the API call, or else authentication will fail and the call will be rejected.

## Footnotes

1. Security is not a primary consideration of HackerPass 1.0 as 1.0 is merely a proof-of-concept. However, it will become more important for 2.0.

\* This documentation is rather ugly and poorly formatted. We should find some other method of documenting.
